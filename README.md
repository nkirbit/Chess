# Chess
Code for a chess game. For fun and learning!

Project started 12/4/20. The rough list of steps I would like to complete are:

1) Define what a piece is, and what a chess board is.
2) Display the board and pieces to the user. This won't be pretty initially, just enough to see the board state.
3) Build system to ask the user for move input, figure out of it is a possible move, and perform the move, update the board, and ask for the next move.
4) Define what a "check" is, and how it restricts moves.
5) Add in elements such as castling and promotion.
6) Add in game ending conditions. Checkmate, Stalemate.  Maybe repeated board states?
7) Once the game structure is complete, work on building a better user interface.
